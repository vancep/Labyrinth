# Labyrinth
Goals of this project:
Remake a previous labyrinth game.
Make a decent menu.
Use ADs.

When running this program in Unity, note that if you start from the Main scene that you are skipping the Menu scene where some settings are set. However, you can just go to the pause menu to navigate back to the main menu if desired.
